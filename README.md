ECMAScript
==========

This project aims to provide an up-to-date .tmLanguage file for the latest [ECMAScript specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1
) including properties and functions of the browser environment.

## Contributing

New rules should be organized according to the [official TextMate language file documentation](http://manual.macromates.com/en/language_grammars).

The language file is split up into multiple JSON files that can be concatenated via grunt. The destination file is ECMAScript.JSON-tmLanguage which is converted using the AAAPackageDev Sublime package. More information on the compilation process can be found [here](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/sublime-text-2/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html).

I will update this README with a more detailed explanation.
